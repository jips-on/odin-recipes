    <p>A scrumptious steak dinner, best served with free-range jelly beans
        The preferred meal of Charlie Kelly, from "It's Always Sunny in Philidelphia".
         Only the finest cuts of beef should be used, and is delicious when served immediately,
          or after fermenting in the trash for a week.</p>
